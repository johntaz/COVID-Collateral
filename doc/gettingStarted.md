### Using Github
- Some tasks can be performed on https://github.com/ :
  + Can be useful for adding files directly to a repository 
  + `Pull requests` (more below)
  + Create/open `issues`
  + Editing code directly 

### Downloading GitHub Desktop
- Download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
- Install locally on your computer or via Remote Desktop through Horizon 
- **Note:** Conducting analyses requires the J:/ Drive. Therefore, this will typically require GitHub to be installed via Remote Desktop
through Horizon

### Getting Started
- Login using your account information from GitHub.com
- Your repositories should now be visible 
- Highlight the repository you're going to work on and click 'Clone' 
  + Specify a path where you want this repository to be stored on your computer
  + This will copy the current contents of the repository to your computer
  
### Example Workflow 
- `Clone` a repository to your computer
- Create a `branch` to work on your code
- `Commit` changes you make on your `branch` and `push` these to Github
- If files are updated you can `pull` to get the most up-to-date files
- Once finalised you can open a `pull request`
- Finally you `merge` your changes to the `Master branch` and delete the `branch`
  
### GitHub Terminology
- Clone
  + Copies a `repository` locally to your computer
- Master branch
  + Where the finalised and up to date files are stored
- Branch/brancing: 
  + Create a `branch` off the `Master branch` to work on prototype code
- Commit:
  + You can `commit` (save) to the `Master branch` directly (not recommended when iterating code)
  + Save changes you make to your `branch` (useful to have sensible commit messages)
- Pull Request:
  + When you are happy with the code you've worked on in your `branch` you can have it reviewed against the `Master branch`
  + You can nominate collaborators as reviewers and they can comment changes or directly provide suggested edits for your code
  + These can be run iteratively to develop a finalised version
- Merge your pull request:
  + This now synchronises your `branch` with the `Master branch` 
  + You can then delete the `branch`, since its changes have been incorporated
- Push:
  + A `push` will sync changes made locally to the relevant branches on Github.com
- Pull:
  + A `pull` will download updates to this repository (made by others) from Github.com
