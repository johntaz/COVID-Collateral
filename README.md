# COVID-Collateral
Study investigating the indirect effects of COVID-19.

While a reduction in hospital activity during the COVID-19 pandemic has been well documented, there has been only limited small scale research on impacts on primary care. We explored the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its control on general practice consultations for adverse acute physical and mental health outcomes in England to inform public health planning and policy.

### Project folder structure

##### Code
- _Run all R code from `COVID-Collateral.Rproj`_
- `data_prep` takes raw CPRD data and aggregates into weekly number of outcomes and weekly denominators by strata. Note - data are held on separate secure server. 
- `its` Interrupted time series analysis code for Figure 3 and Table 3 and sensitivity analysis for diabetes consultations
- `Plot_code` Functions to plot weekly percentage of consultations by outcome (Figures 1 and 2, S2-S4)
- `Shiny_app` All code and data for the accompanying Shiny app
